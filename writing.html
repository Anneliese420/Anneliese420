      <h2>Twilight on the Reef</h2>
      <h5>Descriptive Writing Component</h5>
      <p>As the dawn blushes the awakening sky, the ocean's hue transforms from dusky indigo to delicate turquoise. Hints of coral pink streak the horizon. The peaceful surface of this sunrise sea laps quietly, whispering a lullaby that soothes the world, swaying with a tranquillity that has spanned the ages. Yet beneath the calm cerulean surface, the reef skips with a kaleidoscopic vibrancy that has patterned these tropical waters since they first bore life.</p>

      <p>The clear water, transparent as a polished sapphire, shimmers, reflecting the rosy flush of the rising sun. Each coral formation, with its myriad vivid reds and cool blues, magically phosphoresces in the dim early light, a symbol of nature's ancient powers. Yet a change of focus to the world beyond the water, beyond the dunes, brings into view a lurid path of neon lights that abruptly overwhelms the artistry of the natural. The artificial lights are strung above a wooden path, painted a dull mission-brown, ending at the rusty iron gate of a holiday beach house. Last night's party has spilled out into the morning air. A multitude of empty beer bottles are scattered across the patchy, sandy grass, while an occasional prone body lies unmoving, as if to match the empty bottles' pattern.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, amidst the bustling underwater cityscape, a delicate dance unfolds as the sea-creatures go about their daily rituals. Clownfish dart in and out of their anemone homes, while shimmering schools of angelfish glisten like jewels. Pillars of sunlight filter down through the waves, casting ethereal patterns onto the monumental structures below. Yet even in this seemingly idyllic underwater world, signals of human destructiveness stand as unread warnings. Discarded fishing nets entangle unsuspecting marine life, while almost-imperishable coloured plastic debris disfigures the brilliant shades of the coral, a stark reminder of the fragility of this ecosystem.</p>

      <p>Tourists on a flyover of this once-indigenous wonderland would exclaim excitedly at the vibrant aqua-blue beneath them, with its occasional patches of stronger green and hints of warm red suggesting the rich world of coral life below. They would very likely fail to even notice the spots of human defacement marking the otherwise perfect scene. Speed boats are rocked by the currents. They are there to study the coral life in an effort to protect and preserve it. Their engines spill petrol into gasoline rainbows on the water's surface. Shorewards, fluorescent beach umbrellas are scattered across the naturally yellow-tinged sand. A wire-edged beach accessway eating into the dune system leads back to a stucco-coated bright white beach house.</p>

      <p>---</p>

      <p>As the day matures and the sun approaches its peak, the reef becomes a bustling aquatic CBD buzzing with activity, swarming with life. Schools of fish with iridescent coats of tangerine, chartreuse and amethyst, swim in packs, darting amongst the towers of coral. Sea turtles, so seemingly clumsy on land, glide gracefully through aquamarine avenues, their shells a mosaic of olives and chocolate browns, Their misfortune is to have these streamlined, patterned shells lusted after to be fashioned into human adornments. Overhead, the erratically combining noise of boat and plane engines sounds like a warning, an alarm.</p>

      <p>Despite the similarity in colour to the sapphire of the ocean, the blue of the beach house swimming pool is a chlorinated product, guaranteed to kill off any errant turtle not already choked by plastic bags masquerading as jellyfish. The bleached white of the house's stucco resembles nothing so much as the skeletons of bleached corals that are beginning to proliferate offshore, while the rusted iron gate brings to mind the corroding remains of sunken ships so enthusiastically visited by littering hordes of snorkelers and scuba divers.</p>

      <p>As the morning shifts into late afternoon, the prone bodies on the near-dead lawn disappear, though the untidily-patterned bottles and cigarette butts do not. The scene is singularly one of dereliction, lack of care and abuse. The house and its surrounds are a blight on a once-pristine coastal landscape. Over the ocean the sky is transitioning to a dusky lavender, casting a softly caressing glow onto the gentle swell.  The evening feeding frenzy will soon settle into the almost-silence of the reef at night, bathed in the gentle embrace of twilight and the emergence of galaxies of glistening stars.  Onshore, however, as the darkness unfolds, the garish neon lights blaze back into unnatural life. The party starts once more. Already it blares loudly.</p>

      <h5>Analytical Component of the last paragraph</h5>

      <p>This paragraph thematically displays the contrast between the once-enduring beauty and purpose of nature and its current disruption/destruction through human impact. The cumulation of highly descriptive, negative emotive diction, exemplified in “dereliction, lack of care and abuse” emphasises this impact. Untouched nature is represented through positive emotive language, using sensory imagery such as the tactile 'gentle embrace of twilight' to personify nature as nurturing and life-giving. In contrast, the heavy-sounding compound adjective “near-dead” continues the passage's extended metaphor of the human association with death and destruction. The beautiful visual imagery of 'the sky transitioning to a dusky lavender' is contrasted against the ugly visual of “garish neon lights” while the sibilance of 'almost-silence’ is opposed by the 'blaring' aural imagery associated with the party. The passage's recurrent motif representing the intricate and purposeful patterning of nature is disrupted here by the symbolically 'untidy' human pattern of 'empty bottles and cigarette butts.” The tone of loss evoked by the “once-pristine coastal landscape” creates a sense of sorrow that the positive natural forces that have operated for eons are now being destroyed by human civilisation. The alliterative 'galaxies of glistening stars.” conveys the sense of the vast expanse of nature's beauty beyond man's destructive touch at the same time as alluding to the way that the reef that was once a natural sanctuary is now being impinged upon by the chaos of man. This concept is reinforced by the lengthy, flowing sentences describing nature’s beauty (“Over the ocean…onto the gentle swell’) juxtaposed against the staccato human-describing sentences at the paragraph’s end (‘The party starts once more.’)</p>

      <h2>Before the Candle Dies</h2>
      <p>I lie here paralysed and alone. The burden of my sin weighs upon my chest, exaggerating the difficulty of drawing breath. I feel the spirit of death drawing near, his cold fingers reaching out to claim me. I am afraid. The room is dimly candle-lit. Phantoms of my past words and deeds are dancing shadows on the walls. Soon I will face the ultimate judgement, for eternity is upon me.</p>

      <p>One person consumes my thoughts, one soul whom I have wronged beyond measure - Jane Eyre. I hated her, yet I know that I punished her too cruelly and for too long. Worse, I shattered the deathbed promise I made to my husband Reed. In this, my own last illness, the guilt of that betrayal has become too much, my heart is rending into shards. It is not made of stone after all. Every harsh word, every dismissive gesture haunts the dark recesses of my mind, reverberating reminders of the pain I inflicted upon her. I see now the depth of my offences. The wickedness of convincing her uncle Eyre to believe her dead. I know I will be punished for this, and soon. Conscience, something I long lived without, has become a vicious beast tearing away at the fragile remnants of my blind self-righteousness. I must admit this to myself, even if to no other soul.</p>

      <p>"Oh, Jane” I murmur, my voice heavy with remorse, if only for what I know will be the eternal consequences of my actions. I imagine confessing my sins to her while she sits poised, yet still full of anger. If I were truly sorry, I would say to her: "From the moment you entered my life, a helpless orphan cast upon my doorstep like a beggar, I treated you with disdain and inhumanity. I hated you for the place you held in my husband's heart, just as I hated your mother for the love my husband showed to her. I always suspected that he loved her more, much more, than he loved me. I should not have treated you with such cruelty.” Even now however, it is only in imagination that I speak such words to Jane Eyre. I could not utter them aloud, for pride is still stronger than repentance.</p>

      <p>The heaviness of my self-confession presses down upon me. I blink to clear away the dancing shadows that are blocking my gaze. But now I see that Jane Eyre is truly seated before me, composed and waiting. Comfort is calling me to look away, but the vision of what awaits me forces me to confront her. Is there a glimpse of forgiveness in her eyes? I begin as best I can: “Jane I know I did you wrong, and yet you are here, while my own children are not. You, who I tortured and punished are here, while my children who I ruined through indulgence do not show their faces.”</p>

      <p>I pause and turn away from Jane’s eyes. I do not wish to mortify myself before her. Nevertheless, unbidden, a single tear escapes me. I struggle with the overwhelming magnitude of my emotions. Jane reacts to the gurgling sounds emanating from my throat, swiftly moving to my side, her self-protective facade crumbling. She matches her breath to mine, a steady rhythm amidst the chaos of my turmoil, her hand clasping mine with a tenderness I have rarely felt before. I gaze at our intertwined hands and a pang of regret courses through me. Still, I throw her hand away. I cannot bear to expose myself to her, though certain things I *must* admit.</p>

      <p>“There was a promise I made to your Uncle Reed" I say, trembling with discomfort. "A promise to care for you and provide for your future." I pause, and she grips my hand once more. "But I let pride rule my judgment. Later, I denied you not only material wealth from your Uncle Eyre, but also his love and care." I cannot force myself to say more.</p>

      <p>Jane stands upright, trembling with what must surely be a be a mixture of anger and self-pity. I expect to see tears stream down her face. I expect her words to be sharp with pain and accusation. She should accuse me of being a demon. She should question me harshly: "Why did you treat me in that way? Why do you apologise now after so many years?" If she had so spoken I would have replied as of old: "Jane, I don't like cavillers or questioners!" Yet she says nothing, merely making soothing sounds and attempting to caress my hand. I cannot bear this goodness of heart, this lack of vengeance. Again I turn my head away. Yet with each unspoken accusation I make against myself their undeniable truth dismantles my carefully constructed walls.</p>

      <p>Angry now, I feel I must confront what must surely be her judgmental, if unspoken, thoughts. I launch into a rant: “You have no right to stand as an equal before your Aunt, especially on her death bed” I exclaim, attempting but failing to sit up. I fall back and begin coughing relentlessly, unable to control myself. Jane attempts to calm me, but I fear what she might say now. As she opens her mouth I speak over her, coughing after every other word. “I treated you the way I did because you were a penniless orphan, a no-one. I am better than you, above you. Even now I am not one to stoop to your level or explain myself to you." My voice grows louder with each word, a desperate attempt to drown out the guilt and remorse. Still, she says nothing</p>

      <p>My voice begins to waver, my long-held superiority disintegrating before Jane's fortitude and strength, before her youth, before her courage to stand up for what she believes in. She reminds me so much of Reed. Her eyes glisten with unshed tears, grappling perhaps with her own regrets and fears. As she struggles to voice her feelings, I find myself unravelling.</p>

      <p>I peer into Jane’s eyes and see only sorrow and pity. Her pity wounds me deeply, yet I pray silently for her forgiveness. She begins to speak in gentle tones: "Love me or hate me as you will. You have my full and free forgiveness. Ask now for God’s and be at peace."</p>

      <p>I cannot bear such Christian charity. I turn my head away from her. My eyes become heavy, and I sink under a wave of exhaustion.</p>
